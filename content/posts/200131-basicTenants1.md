Title: A rough sketch of my philosophy today, I
Date: 2020-01-31

What features should the optimal philosophy possess?

A philosophy should be pragmatic. It should be oriented towards the world as it is and it should inform our decisions.

We all have models in our heads about how the world works. The hope is that these models are reasonable and updatable. Reasonable in the sense of accuracy and usability. A model that is inaccurate is not worth having, but a model can be too complex to be useful. Models should be updatable on two levels. First, if there are some sort of parameters, like the degree to which we believe the world is controlled by a hegemony of lizard people, we want to be able to use evidence to change these parameters. Second, we should be able to throw out the entire model if we find it does a poor job to make room for a better one.

Both of these aspects, reasonability and updatability, rely on empirical data. Empiricism is important, because, as the success of science demonstrates, it is the most effective tool we have to learn about the world. However, every real world decision we find ourselves making has an element of uncertainty to it. Frequently we cannot quantify this uncertainty. So we should use empiricism when we can, but have heuristics that can help us to make decisions under uncertainty.

A philosophy should make us happy. Why bother with one if we are just going to make ourselves depressed?

Neitzsche's philosophy placed a foremost value on truth and this led him to misery. In *The Gay Science*, he bemoans the difficulty of maintaining his philosophy when encountering other people, and questions it's usefulness. Truth is not valuable for it's own sake.

We should be able to make the best of bad situations, and enjoy good ones. This does not mean we should be hedonists. It also does not mean we should be ascetics. We should ask the question "Why not?" rather than "Why?". After all, why does the universe exist? Well, why not? We should not hide from harsh truths, but we should also not let them depress us.

A philosophy should fail gracefully.

We are frequently wrong. We should be able to make amends, improve our mental models, and continue on our way when we are. We should be able to learn from our mistakes, rather than pretending they never happened. We should give people the benefit of the doubt -- at least in non-life-or-death scenarios.
