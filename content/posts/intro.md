Title: And so it begins
Date: 2019-12-20

Greetings, friends, and welcome to Less Foolish.

Philosophers modestly called themselves “lovers of wisdom”, rather than “the wise”, or something similarly egotistical. While a lover of wisdom might hope to accumulate some wisdom through years of experience and thought, there is no guarantee that one will become wise. After all, if you consider your past self of five years ago foolish, how likely is it that your future self five years hence will consider your present self to have finally achieved wisdom?

No, the philosophers were correct. We can aspire to become wiser, but we are likely deceived if we consider ourselves wise in a broad sense. This blog is a chronicle of my stumbling journey on a prematurely-ending path towards wisdom. I invite you to accompany me on my way, and maybe we can together become somewhat Less Foolish.

I would be remiss if I did not also mention the connection between this site name and that of [Less Wrong][1]. I owe that community an intellectual debt, in particular, to [Scott Alexander][2]. I hope my choice of site name is interpreted as a complement, which is my intent. After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

In keeping with the name of this webpage and the idea of a journey through Foolishness towards Less Foolishness, I proclaim now at the beginning that all these writings should be considered hypotheses. These hypotheses are both uncertain, and my belief in them is likely time decaying as I learn more and aspire to be Less Foolish.
